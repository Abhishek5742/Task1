Titanic Data Preprocessing Project

Project Summary:
In this project, I prepared the Titanic dataset for machine learning by cleaning and organizing the data. Since real-world data often contains missing values and unnecessary information, preprocessing is an essential step before model training.

Work Done:
Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
Checked and handled missing values
Removed unnecessary columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)
Filled missing Age values with mean
Filled missing Embarked values with mode
Converted categorical data (Male → 0, Female → 1)
Applied one-hot encoding for Embarked
Performed feature scaling on Age and Fare using StandardScaler
Saved the cleaned dataset as titanic_cleaned.csv

Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Learning Outcome:
This project improved my understanding of data cleaning, handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling in the machine learning workflow.
